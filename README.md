# Multi-Domain-Transfer-Learning


## Getting Started
The project is about predicting the thermal comfort of senior people. 
For running the framework, this work recommends creating a new virtual environment which uses the python version 3.8.8
Afterwards, install the packages in the requirements.txt of the requirements_files directory to get started.

**For Bash:**  

python3 -m venv .venv  
source .venv/bin/activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Datasets:**

We use the datasets from the paper of Pengfei Liu, Xipeng Qiu, and Xuanjing Huang. 2017. Adversarial Multi-task Learning for Text Classification. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of theAssociation for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers). Associationfor Computational Linguistics, Vancouver, Canada, 1â€“10.
